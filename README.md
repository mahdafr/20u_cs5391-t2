# Assignment# 2

In this task, you will be implementing a python-based simple mail client, which can send email to any recipient. Your email client should connect to a mail server and communicate using the SMTP protocol.

_Note_: You are not allowed to use the `smtplib` python library.

## Part I
Using sockets, connect to campus SMTP mail server. Then implement the smtp conversations in the python program `myUtepEmailClient.` which will contact with the server to send your email to "your_email@utep.edu". 

## Part II
Using sockets, connect to a popular webmail server, like AOL mail server. Then perform the same task as Part-I and implement the smtp conversations in the python program `myExternalEmailClient.py` which will contact with the SMTP server to send your email to "your_email@gmail.com".
